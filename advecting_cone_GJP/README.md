# Advecting cone

This is a testing case for Gradient Jump Penalisation (GJP) using for Continuous Galerkin (CG) method using advecting cone. Without GCP, wiggles/dispersion which pollute the solution are expected. If not, then the mesh should be coarser.

For the reference case, please see https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2021.114200 from Spencer J. Sherwin's group using Nektar++.
